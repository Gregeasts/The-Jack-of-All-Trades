The Jack of All Trades - Card Games

## Overview

This project contains a set of web-based card games built as part of a software engineering placement task in my application for a role within Hawk-Eye Innovations. 

Included games:  
1. **Higher or Lower** – Guess whether the next card is higher or lower than the current one.  
2. **21!** – Play against a simple dealer AI with multi-round betting.  
3. **The Jack** - An original game with the Jack as the main card involved!

## Project Decisions

- **Animations and sounds** were added to enhance user experience and make the game feel more interactive and lively.  
- **Multi-round betting** was implemented to add a layer of strategy and replayability.  
- **Dealer AI** for 21 uses a simple threshold system. 
- GUI chosen over CLI to demonstrate front-end skills and creativity.

### Possible Improvements

- Implement **more sophisticated AI** for twenty one
- Include **statistics tracking** for win/loss ratios.  
- Add alternative game modes
