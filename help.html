      <h2> Higher or Lower</h2>
      <p>

      <h2> 21!</h2>
      <p>
        Draw cards to get as close to 21 as you dare by hitting the hit button and hit stand when you do not want to risk anymore. Hope that the dealer can't beat you!

      <h2> The Jack</h2>
      <p>
        The Jack is a unique and original card game. Cards are A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J. Each players task is to get a streak from A-10 by picking up and placing down cards into the two middle piles. The down pile is shuffled between every turn. Jacks can replace any numerical card, acting as that number.
